# Card-game-21-
Here are the rules for playing the card game, “21”: A player tries to collect cards whose total score is 21 or as close as possible. 
The player with the highest score not exceeding 21 wins. (If the player’s score is higher than 21, the player is “busted” and loses.)
A card’s has a point value based on its count (e.g., a four of clubs is valued 4), but face cards are valued 10, and we will say that an 
ace is valued 11. Initially, each player receives two cards from the dealer. Then, each player can request additional cards, one at a time,
from the dealer. After all the players have received desired additional cards, the players reveal their hands. Write an application that
lets a computerized dealer, a human player, and a computerized player play 21. The computerized player should be smart enough to request 
additional cards as long as the player’s total score is 16 or less.
